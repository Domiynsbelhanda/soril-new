      <h3><strong>Opportunity</strong><br />Overview</h3>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 30px">
            One of the key reasons why attendees come to ARiMaS events is to establish 
            contacts and to network with other African risk leaders and service providers 
            working in the risk management field in Africa. So, social events such as the 
            welcome drinks, conference dinner, lunches and breaks are very well attended.
  
        </p> 
        <p style="margin-bottom: 30px">
            Being a sponsor at the conference demonstrates your commitment to the African 
            risk leaders’ community and enhances your brand not only with attendees but with 
            anyone who visits the Conference website or engages on social media.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 30px">
            You will also have an exclusive right to secure space to hold private meetings 
            or events with customers, prospects, or industry partners in the Conference facilities. 
            You can therefore accomplish a year’s worth of meetings in a single week, further 
            enhancing the sponsorship return on investment. Conference Sponsorship Options
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 30px">
            For companies wishing to target a specific day, materials, or social events during the conference, 
            individual sponsorship provides an attractive option. This allows your organisation to choose your 
            desired level of involvement and exposure to attendees at the conference.
