                        Risk leadership is the ability of business leaders (board and senior management members) to
                        steer their organisations’ risk agenda.
                        <br>
                        Without risk leadership an organisation lacks the overall vision, direction, knowledge, and
                        values needed to shape its approach to risk management.

                                            (Some organisations prefer to articulate appetite according to a common risk taxonomy that is
                                            based on common characteristics of risk. This approach emphasises acceptable levels of risk
                                            given the unique consideration of each type of risk. However, this approach may result in an
